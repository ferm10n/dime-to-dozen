# Dime To Dozen

The motivation for this project was to explore and understand the limits of "vibe coding". I also wanted to get exposure to Deno, Vue 3, drizzle, neon, deno-deploy, while making something practical.

My goal was to prioritize speed with creating a MVP, and simplicity over fanciness. I know the auth system isn't the most amazing thing ever (at least for now)
